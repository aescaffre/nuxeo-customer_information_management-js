nuxeo-customer_information_management-js
========================================

JavaScript frontend for customer information management with Nuxeo, as a sample demonstrator of the use of [Nuxeo JavaScript client SDK](https://github.com/nuxeo/nuxeo-js-client) for building client side user interfaces.

In this sample, we use simple frameworks and the least of tooling, so as to provide a very easy and quick start. Frameworks are limited to:
- Bootstrap for css
- JQuery
- Mustache for templating
- JQuery plugin for Mustache

To start adapting this sample to your own use case you only need:
- a text editor
- a Nuxeo instance with [CORS config](http://doc.nuxeo.com/x/vIvZ) 
- a Studio project for you document types (If you really are into customer information management, just ask me to share the Studio jar, I'm doing lazy sharing on that one ;-)

The following [blog post](http://www.nuxeo.com/blog/development/2014/03/developping-content-application-mustachejs-bootstrap-nuxeojs/) describes what has been done, and provide a link to a video.
